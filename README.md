# Welcome to MireHouse 
This is a wareshouse management website that can manage products and store data to  a non-sql based database called mongo db. You can have a look of this site [here](https://the-summit-gear.web.app/)

# Technologies

I have used these technologies for this site 

## For frontend

 - React JS
 - React Router 
 - Tailwind CSS
 - React Icons
 - React Hot Toast
 - Google Firebase(for authentication and deploy on web)
 - yarn(for managing the whole node project)
 

It was easy to choose ReactJS for main frontend library for the project. then I chose react router to make multiple pages for these single page app. tailwind felt me perfect to make fast and easy. Lastly I use Google's firebase authenticatiion that felt me secure and also provided hosting service to store the deployed website 

## For Backend

 - NodeJS
 - ExpressJS
 - MongoDB
 - JWT token

As a javascript developer, Node is the perfect option me to write server-side code for the project . I used expressJS to make my task faster with node .  I used MongoDB for database as it provides non-SQL database that suits best with my code-base . Lastly I used JWT token to make a secure connection between backend and database. 

## Thank you for visiting this project, I hope you will like it
